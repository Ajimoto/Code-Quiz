# Code-Quiz

code quiz challenge

# Purpose

The quiz app was a great way to test the skills I learned in class. It was much harder than I anticipated and I should have taken more time to work out the kinks. Some of the functions in the app don't work 100% to the level I would like. However with more time applied I could create a much better quiz.

# Function

The use can click the 'Start' button and a timer will start. the user has to select the right answer to increase the score. Once all the questions are answered the timer will stop and the user will be prompted to input a name. the name will be saved to local storage and displayed in the footer section labeled 'highscore'

# summary

Much of my code is repetitive and needs to be refactored. I need to spend more time on this project and will finish it this weekend. Even still, I am submitting it as is for grade/deadline purposes.
